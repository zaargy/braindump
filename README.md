# Braindump

![BrainDump](client/build/icon.png)

Braindump is a distraction-free ever-rotating text editor I use for journaling.

At the moment, it simply writes files to ~/.msmtpqueue. From crontab, I run
mailer-cron.sh from crontab and what I wrote is emailed to me once I'm online.

Code is a bit messy but it works. Maybe I'll tidy it up some day.

I use it on OS X and Linux.

It does seem a bit silly to use Electron for this but I wanted something that works
consistently across OS X and Linux.
